# ⭐ Start Here

[**Yarn Spinner**](https://yarnspinner.dev) **is the friendly tool for writing dialogue in games.** It's easy for writers to use, and has powerful features for programmers.&#x20;

Yarn Spinner is free, and open source and has been used in thousands of amazing games, including [Night in the Woods](http://nightinthewoods.com), [A Short Hike](https://ashorthike.com), [Lost in Random](https://www.ea.com/en-au/games/lost-in-random), [Dredge](https://www.dredge.game), [Frog Detective](https://frogdetective.net), [Button City](https://www.buttoncitygame.com), [Escape Academy](https://escapeacademygame.com/en), [Baladins](https://www.baladinsgame.com), and [Unbeatable](https://www.unbeatablegame.com).

First, let’s get some terminology out of the way. Yarn Spinner has a few **Core Components**, as well as some **Yarn Labs Experiments**.&#x20;

### Core Components

These are production-ready components, with stable, established, released versions:

* **Yarn**, the language you write your dialogue and narrative in: you write Yarn _scripts_.
* **Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code**, the _extension_ for the popular free text editor, Visual Studio Code, that gives it an understanding of the Yarn language, and helps you to write Yarn _scripts_.
* **Yarn Spinner for Unity**, the package you use to _import_ and _use_ your Yarn scripts in games you build in Unity.
* **Try Yarn Spinner**, an online tool that allows you to write Yarn scripts and Play them in a web browser. It's useful to write basic Yarn, and test things out. It's just a [website](https://try.yarnspinner.dev) you can visit!

### Yarn Labs Experiments

These are experimental projects that are likely to eventually be released, but are currently in early, or experimental stages:

* **Yarn Spinner for Unreal**, the package you use to _import_ and _use_ your _Yarn scripts_ in games you build in Unreal.
* **Yarn Spinner for Godot**, the package you use to _import_ and _use_ your _Yarn scripts_ in games you build in Godot.

## Getting Started

The best way to get started with Yarn Spinner, using the **Core Components**, is to work through our [**Beginner's Guide**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MUzdrP-qDd2PGa85Yan/s/-MUzduXovTOfMmBpZ0Wi/\~/changes/120/beginners-guide), which is a gentle introduction to:

1. [**Syntax Basics**](beginners-guide/syntax-basics.md) — Using **Try Yarn Spinner** to learn the basic syntax for writing Yarn, the language for writing dialogue in Yarn scripts.&#x20;
2. [**Writing Narratives**](beginners-guide/writing-narratives.md)  — Moving to **Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code**, and learning how to structure narratives and stories using features of the Yarn language.
3. [**Making a Game with Unity**](beginners-guide/making-a-game-with-unity.md) — Using **Yarn Spinner for Unity** and learning more advanced Yarn language features, as well as integrating logic from Yarn script with what’s happening in the game engine, as well as one way of nicely displaying your dialogue in-game.
