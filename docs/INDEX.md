## Are you brand new to Yarn Spinner?

You should start with our [Beginner's Guide](beginners-guide/welcome.md).&#x20;

No need to install anything first, just start with the [Beginner's Guide](beginners-guide/welcome.md), and work your way through three guided tutorials on the syntax of writing Yarn scripts, installing a text editor to write Yarn scripts, and then integrating Yarn scripts with your game, and installing Yarn Spinner as a package into your game engine.&#x20;

We'd also recommend joining the [Yarn Spinner Discord](https://discord.gg/yarnspinner), where you can show off your work, and ask for help.

Yarn Spinner is not just a single project or tool, but is a collection of projects and tools. It consists of a language to write your narratives in—Yarn—and tools to display, and use your Yarn in game engines, like Unity, and tools to translate, localize, and connect voice over to your stories.&#x20;
