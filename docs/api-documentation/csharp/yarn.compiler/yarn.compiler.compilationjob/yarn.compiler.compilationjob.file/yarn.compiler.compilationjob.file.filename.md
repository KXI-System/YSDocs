# FileName

Field in [File](./)

## Summary

The name of the file.

```csharp
public string FileName;

## Remarks

This may be a full path, or just the filename or anything in between. This is useful for diagnostics, and for attributing [Line](../../../yarn/yarn.line/) objects to their original source files.
