# ‚≠ê About Add-Ons

Yarn Spinner is always free and open source. To help offset the costs of designing, building, and support Yarn Spinner, we provide a number of add-ons as paid extras to make implementing Yarn Spinner in your games easier for you.

At the moment, these include:

* Dialogue Wheel for Yarn Spinner
* Speech Bubbles for Yarn Spinner

This section of the Yarn Spinner documentation provides guides for the available add-ons.
