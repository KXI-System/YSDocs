# ðŸ§¶ Understanding the Project

First, letâ€™s get some terminology out of the way. Yarn Spinner has a few **Core Components**, as well as some **Yarn Labs Experiments**.&#x20;

### Core Components

These are production-ready components, with stable, established, released versions:

* **Yarn**, the language you write your dialogue and narrative in: you write Yarn _scripts_.
* **Yarn Spinner for Visual Studio Code**, the _extension_ for the popular free text editor, Visual Studio Code, that gives it an understanding of the Yarn language, and helps you to write Yarn _scripts_.
* **Yarn Spinner for Unity**, the package you use to _import_ and _use_ your Yarn scripts in games you build in Unity.
* **Try Yarn Spinner**, an online tool that allows you to write Yarn scripts and Play them in a web browser. It's useful to write basic Yarn, and test things out. It's just a [website](https://try.yarnspinner.dev) you can visit!

**Yarn Spinner for Unreal** is moving from Yarn Labs to Core Components in late-2023.

### Yarn Labs Experiments

These are experimental projects that are likely to eventually be released, but are currently in early, or experimental stages:

* **Yarn Spinner for Unreal**, the package you use to _import_ and _use_ your _Yarn scripts_ in games you build in Unreal.
* **Yarn Spinner for Godot**, the package you use to _import_ and _use_ your _Yarn scripts_ in games you build in Godot.
